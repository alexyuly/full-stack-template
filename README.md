The purpose of this repo is to provide a very generic and very
minimalistic template for a full-stack socket-based Node.js web app
using react, redux, webpack, socket.io, and friends.

## Notes

- The npm scripts include some Unix-only syntax like `rm` and setting
environment variables using `key=value`. If you run Windows you'll need
to change them.

## TODO

- Write more unit tests
- Refactor duplicated code in client and server stores to be shared
