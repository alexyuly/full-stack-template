# Minimal React App [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/alexyuly/minimal-react-app/tree/master.svg?style=shield&circle-token=:circle-token)](https://circleci.com/gh/alexyuly/minimal-react-app)

Create React apps with minimal build configuration.

## Get Started

To get started, clone this repository, and then add your own remote origin:

```
cd your_development_directory
git clone https://github.com/alexyuly/minimal-react-app
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin url_to_your_git_repository
```

To start your app in development mode, run `yarn start`.

To build your app in production mode, run `yarn build`. This creates two files in the `build` directory, `app.js` and `index.html`, which can be served on the web.
